This project showcases the reverse engineering and modification of the original Pou (v1.4.124) Android APK to create a custom version called CyberPou+. The APK was decompiled using tools like apktool and modified at the smali code level to inject new functionality and visual changes. Key modifications included adding a custom Toast message and playing a sound using MediaPlayer on app launch, replacing the app icon and name, and displaying a monitoring notice to the user. Changes were implemented directly in the App.smali file, and the app was recompiled and signed with a custom certificate. To ensure security and stability, the modified APK was analyzed using MobSF and compared to the original. The project maintained the original appâ€™s permissions and avoided introducing any malicious behavior, demonstrating secure reverse engineering practices and APK modification techniques.
